📌 Project Overview

Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is one of the world's most densely populated megacities, home to over 20 million people. With 75-80% of residents living in rented houses, rent prices have surged by 29% over the past five years. On average, more than 65% of a household’s income goes toward rent, making affordability a significant concern.

House rent prices in Dhaka fluctuate due to multiple factors. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model to predict rental costs based on these influencing variables:

Location 📍

Area (sqft) 📏

Number of Bedrooms 🛏

Number of Bathrooms 🛁

The dataset used for training and testing the model was web-scraped from bproperty.com, a real estate platform that provides rental listings across the city.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature engineering.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing rental price trends.
✅ Model Selection & Training – Comparing multiple models to find the best one.
✅ Random Forest Model – The best-performing model for rent prediction.
✅ Rent Prediction Function – A user-friendly function to estimate rent prices.
✅ Deployment Ready – Can be integrated into a web app using Flask/FastAPI.
