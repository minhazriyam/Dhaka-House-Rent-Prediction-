# Dhaka-House-Rent-Prediction-

Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is one of the world's most densely populated megacities, home to over 20 million people. With 75-80% of residents living in rented houses, rent prices have surged by 29% over the past five years. On average, more than 65% of a householdâ€™s income goes toward rent, making affordability a significant concern.

House rent prices in Dhaka fluctuate due to multiple factors. In this project, I have developed a Machine Learning model to predict rental costs based on these influencing variables.

The dataset used for training and testing the model was web-scraped from bproperty.com, a real estate platform that provides rental listings across the city.
